1. Complete Results for at Least One Research Question
To Do:
Fix the emissions variable (use proportional distribution based on energy demand).
Re-run the causal inference analysis.
Provide clear interpretation of coefficients and statistical significance for both stages.

3. Diagnostic Tests and Robustness Checks
To Do:
Perform and report diagnostics (heteroscedasticity, normality).
Discuss the limitations and potential violations of assumptions (e.g., unobserved confounders, endogeneity).
Conduct robustness checks (e.g., alternative instruments or adding confounders).

5. Visualizations of Results
To Do:
Add confidence intervals or error bands to regression plots.
Include additional visualizations for non-linear effects (e.g., quadratic terms or interaction plots).

7. Written Interpretations
To Do:
Summarize findings for the first- and second-stage regressions.
Discuss real-world implications and potential policy recommendations.

9. Limitations and Next Steps
To Do:
Discuss data limitations (e.g., proportional emissions assumption, lack of industrial activity data).
Outline future extensions (e.g., adding regional/state-level data).
